    - Collects the "txs" lines where the packet transmission is successful, extracting the timestamp, rate, and power.
    - Separates "txs" lines based on the power type (e.g., "set_power", "set_power_rc").

    Parameters
    -----------
    file_path : str

    - For the "txs" trace type, only lines with a successful packet transmission are processed, extracting the rate and power.

    timestamp across all iterations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iteration_files_dict : dict
        A dictionary where keys are iteration identifiers (e.g., "1", "2", etc.) and values are lists of file paths
        to the trace response CSV files corresponding to each iteration.

    Returns
    -------
    list of dict
        A list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents an averaged entry. Each dictionary contains the following keys:
        - `time`: The timestamp of the trace event.
        - `mode`: The mode associated with the trace event.
        - `trace_type`: The type of trace (e.g., "txs", "est_tp").
        - `est_tp`: The estimated throughput (if present).
        - `rate`: The average rate (if present).
        - `power`: The average power (if present).
        - `power_type`: The power type (if present).

    Notes
    -----
    - The function averages data for each row index based on the first iteration's timestamps.
    - If no data is found for an iteration, that iteration is skipped.
    - The `rate` and `power` values are averaged across all available entries for each row index.
    - If the `power_type` and `mode` match, the function ensures that those entries are averaged together.
